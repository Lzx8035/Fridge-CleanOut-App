# Welcome to Lea's very first personal Project! 👋

🌐 Check out my website: https://fridge-clean-out.netlify.app/

🚀 API documentation: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

Please note: I am currently using the free tier of the API service. This means there is a very low daily limit on the number of API requests this project can make. It's like a daily allowance of ice cream scoops, once they're gone, they're gone! 🍨

Thus if you encounter some error with API requests, it may be due to reaching this daily limit. In such cases, please wait until the next day when the quota resets. 😢

Thank you for your interest in my project. Happy coding! 🎉
